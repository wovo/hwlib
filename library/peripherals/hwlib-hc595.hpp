/// hc595 8-bit output shift register 
/// 
/// This class implements an interface to 
/// an hc595 8-bit output shift register chip.  
///
/// \image html hc595-pinout.png
///
/// The hc595 is an 8-bit serial-in parallel-out shift register, 
/// connected to an 8-bit data storage register.
/// The 8 outputs of the data register are available on chip pins.
/// The power supply range is 2.0 .. 6.0 Volt.
///
/// \image html hc595-diagram.png
///
/// The HC595 can be used as SPI output-only peripheral:
///    - connect MR (active-low reset input) to the power
///    - connect OE (active-low output enable) to gound
///    - use DS as MOSI
///    - use SHCP as SLCK
///    - use STCP as SS
///
/// Note that STCP is not a real chip-select: the chip will always
/// respond to the data that is clocked by storing it in the shift register.
/// But only the chip that got the select signal will (on the rising edge
/// of the SS) transfer the data from the shift register to the storage 
/// register, hence affecting the outputs.
///
/// The next code shows a kitt display 
/// on 8 LEDs connected to the HC595 output pins:
/// \snippet "db103\hc595\main.cpp" [Doxygen hc595 example]
///
/// The 74HCT595 is a similar chip, but intended (only) for 5V power,
/// and for use with the old TTL signal levels 
/// (HC chips are for the CMOS signal levels that are more common now).
